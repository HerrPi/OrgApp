Project to learn Coding

This is a Project i am working on to learn Coding.
I started in January 2020 to Code my first Line in C++ - and then started in March 2020 with Swift.

This Project started with an simple ToDo functionality.

Git-History is poor, cause i didnt implement it in early stages.
Now i try to keep things up, that you and me can follow my progress.
